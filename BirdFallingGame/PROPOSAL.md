I want to build a 2D skydiving game. So in this game, there would be an object flying across the top and when the player hits space bar the object starts falling and
the goal of the game is to land the object on a target. There will be wind/air resistance factors that will affect the velocity of the object. The objective of the game is to hit space hit at the right time so when the object falls it will land on a target. 

Towards this project, I have taken a physics class and I think it would be fun to simulate a falling object. I think it will be a fun and simple game to learn how air affects falls and I hope to make as realistic as possible. Obviously the graphics probably won't be the best, but I hope to make it enjoyable and fun to play. I really want to see this project out so I can show my friends and family or employers. I think it would be a cool project to show off. 

Week 1: Implement the constraints of the screen such as locations of the box. Implement an object to fly across the screen when the space bar is pressed and then go downward when the space bar is presssed again. Implement the physics of the object falling including a wind feature and air resistance.

Week 2: Implement a target at the bottom and a score feature to be calculated based on where the object lands. Add objects to move around in the air. Make it like pinball so the more objects you hit the higher your score and the bottom target block gives you the highest score. Take care of object collision.

Week 3: Implement the game to repeat when finished jumping so users can keep jumping and implement a scoreboard to show the score of every jump they made. Add function that allows users to have jump with different objects. Stretch week. 

ideas: kd trees for collisions?
